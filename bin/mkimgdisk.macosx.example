# The root-level Makefile calls this in order to create a virtual image that can be boot, e.g., in vmware
# This is included as an example, and will probably need to be tailored to your own environment.  Notice
# that this script uses a mnt/ directory at the same level as the Makefile, as well as vm/ dir (relative
# to the Makefile).  It assumes that there is already a floppy image (ext2.img) that has an ext2 filesystem
# on it, and grub's first- and second-stage bootloaders installed.  The SVN repository should also contain
# such a floppy image with some arbitrary version of the kernel installed.
# This version requires MacFuse and fuse-ext2
