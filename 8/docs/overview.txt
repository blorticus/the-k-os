K-OS (pronounced "chaos")

DESCRIPTION:
------------
K-OS (pronounced "chaos") is an Operating System optimized for console enviroments.  The primary
efficiencies focus on video and sound operation.  The OS will provide an API oriented for these
operations, making simple things fast and easy.  While multiple processors may eventually be
supported, IA-32 and IA-64 is the initial focus.  All aspects of kernel operation must scale in
a multi-processor (or core) environment.  Only a limited set of hardware drivers must be supported.
A graphical environment will be provided, but it generally assumes task-orientation, so does not
need to provide the same semantics one would find in a standard windowing system.
