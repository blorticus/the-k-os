SVN:

|-- trunk
|-- milestones
|-- branches

The trunk/ is for the latest version of code.  It should be functional code.  If one wishes
to work off the trunk/, one should cut a new branch.  Branches are currently serially numbered
(1, 2, 3, ...).  Milestones are essentially "tagged" versions, but before the first real version.
They are serially numbered.
